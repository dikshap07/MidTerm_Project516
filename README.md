Comparison and Evaluation of various models in R

## Table of Contents
### 1) Executive summary of your findings
### 2) Introduction (explain what you are trying to learn and why)
### 3) Data (description of the data and sources â€“ you can use the UCI link provided to get this information)
### 4) Methods (describe the modeling and error estimation methods you used and why you chose them; this is also the section to discuss results of diagnostics and steps needed to correct problems, if any)
### 5) Results (discuss how well your model model(s) fit the data and enables you to interpret the relationship between individual predictors and response; if you feel it is not possible to produce a reliably interpretable model that has accuracy that is competitive with all other models, be sure to state why this is the case).
